# Welcome Everyone!{.smaller} 

We're starting our second `R-Crash` course called `Mastering R II: The Journey Continues`

My name is `Francesca Picone`. I have just joined the `R-Ladies Rome` organizers' team. As a Statistician and an Actuary my background includes expertise in data analysis and Risk management.

Together with `Federica Gazzelloni`, we're excited to have you here for our second R-Crash course.

`Federica` will help you revisit the basics of R, reinforcing your understanding of its core concepts. After that, we'll dive into the world of data wrangling, reshape, and prepare messy data for analysis. To eventually apply the first line of regression models.

# Today's R-Crash Course {.smaller}

<center>![](https://media.giphy.com/media/3o72F7RrTPW6jymXew/giphy.gif)</center>

We're all set and ready to begin! We'll be utilizing `Posit Cloud`, which means you won't need to install anything â€“ we can jump right into the coding.

In this second session, I'll walk you through the steps of `using R to analyze data` and eventually `create a report`. After the demonstration, you'll have the opportunity to continue your data analysis just as we did together.

Once the course concludes, you'll receive an email containing a brief assignment. Upon successful completion of the assignment and the submission of your report at <rome@rladies.org>, you'll be awarded a `Certificate of Successful Completion of the R-Crash` from `R-Ladies Rome`.

So, let's dive right in and make the most of this hands-on `R-data analysis adventure`!
