# Today's presentation {.smaller}

Hold on tight as we introduce you to the remarkable `Dr. Laura H. Kahn`. For those of you who don't know about her. She is a physician, an author, and educator who has dedicated almost two decades to the `Program on Science and Global Security at Princeton University School of Public and International Affairs`. 

Dr. Kahn's groundbreaking work is not only transforming the way we approach public health crises, but it has also launched a global initiative - the `One Health Initiative`. Her visionary 2006 publication "Confronting Zoonoses, Linking Human and Veterinary Medicine" in the CDC journal Emerging Infectious Diseases set the stage for this revolutionary movement that recognizes the interconnectivity between human, animal, plant, environmental, and ecosystem health. 

# Today's presentation {.smaller}

With two books already under her belt, including `"Who's in Charge?"` and `"One Health and the Politics of Antimicrobial Resistance"` Dr. Kahn has become a celebrated leader in public health. 

Her most recent venture, a Coursera course titled `"Bats, Ducks, and Pandemics: An Introduction to One Health Policy"`, has attracted thousands of students worldwide. Her efforts have earned her numerous awards, including the prestigious K.F. Meyer-James H. Steele Gold Head Cane Award from the American Veterinary Epidemiology Society. With her next book on `One Health and coronaviruses` set to be released soon, there's no doubt that Dr. Kahn's groundbreaking work will continue to have a lasting impact on global health for years to come.
