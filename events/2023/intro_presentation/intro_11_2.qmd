and engaging `panel discussions`. These gatherings have all shared a
common theme: our passion for `R programming`, `data science`, and
`statistics.`

Recent highlights include discussions on topics such as

# Today's presentation {.smaller .r-fit-text}

Cara is a data visualisation consultant with an academic background, specialising in helping research teams and data-driven organisations turn their data insights into to clear and compelling visualisations.

She lives in Edinburgh, Scotland, with her husband and two young daughters. Cara regularly shares coding tips for dataviz online, and genuinely enjoys helping others level up their dataviz skills through talks, bespoke organisational training, and one-to-one coaching.

In this talk, we will explore how to make text work for us, by first considering how much of it we really need. Once we've decluttered and explored how we can use colours to be less text-dependent, we'll look at how to optimise text hierarchy in descriptions and in-plot annotations to keep the main thing the main thing, and how to create dynamic content and alignments. Finally, we'll explore coding tricks to apply these typography tips to tables and interactive plots, giving readers additional information on demand.
Throughout the talk, Cara will share the packages and code snippets used to create and modify plots in R straight from readily available data.
