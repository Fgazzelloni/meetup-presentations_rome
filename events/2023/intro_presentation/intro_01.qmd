# Tonight presentation {.smaller}

Tonight speaker is **Julia Silge**, for those of you who do not know about her...

Julia is a data scientist and software engineer at **Posit PBC** where she works on open source machine learning tools. She holds a PhD in astrophysics and has worked as a data scientist in tech and the nonprofit sector, as well as a technical advisory committee member for the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. She is an author, an international keynote speaker, and a real-world practitioner focusing on data analysis and machine learning. Julia loves text analysis, making beautiful charts, and communicating about technical topics with diverse audiences.

In this meetup, we will be learning what **Machine learning operations (MLOps)** is, what principles can be used to create a practical MLOps strategy, and what kinds of tasks and components are involved.

At the end of the meetup we will be hosting a `Q&A session`.
