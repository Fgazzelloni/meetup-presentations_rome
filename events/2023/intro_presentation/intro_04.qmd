# Tonight's presentation {.smaller}

Welcome to this exciting event where we will be exploring the world of
`modeling diseases with R`.

Our speakers, `Federica Gazzelloni` and `Jacqueline Buros`, will be
taking us on a journey through both `deterministic` and `Bayesian` SIR model
methods, providing us with fascinating insights into each field.

At the heart of our discussion is the well-known Sir model, which will
help us understand how an epidemic might unfold and what measures can be
taken to prevent its spread. Whether you are a student of science, a
healthcare professional, or simply someone who wants to understand more
about how to use R for modeling diseases, this talk promises to be
insightful!

We will begin with a quick intro assessment of the SIR model with R by
Federica Gazzelloni. Jacqueline Buros will then take us through a
Bayesian workflow for disease transmission.

At the end of the event we will be hosting a `Q&A session`.
