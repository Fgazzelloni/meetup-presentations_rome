We are excited to share that we recently posted a request for new

we've received 14 enthusiastic responses from highly qualified
individuals who are eager to be part of this new venture.

We're especially thrilled to have heard from two individuals based in

# Tonight presentation {.smaller}

Tonight speaker is **`Isabella Velásquez`**, for those of you who do not
know about her...

Isabella is an R enthusiast, first learning the programming language
during her MSc in Analytics. Previously, Isabella conducted data
analysis and research, developed infrastructure to support the use of
data, and created resources and trainings. Her work on the **Posit
(formerly RStudio) Marketing team** draws on these experiences to create
content that supports and strengthens data science teams. In her spare
time, Isabella enjoys playing with her tortoiseshell cat, watching film
analysis videos, and hiking in the mountains around Seattle. **Find her
on Twitter and Mastodon: @ivelasq3**

In this meetup, we will be learning about **What's new in the
tidyverse** a suite of packages that's revolutionized data wrangling,
visualization, and analysis.

At the end of the meetup we will be hosting a `Q&A session`.
