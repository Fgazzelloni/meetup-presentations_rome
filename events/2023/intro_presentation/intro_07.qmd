# Today's R-Crash Course {.smaller}

We are ready to get started! We will be diving into some basic code for analyzing data from the `#TidyTuesday` project. It's a weekly event within the R-Community, offering diverse datasets for practice with a variety of different types of data content. 

We'll be using Posit Cloud, eliminating the need for any installations, so we can jump right into coding.

In this session, I'll guide you through the steps for analyzing some data. After that, we'll split into breakout rooms, where you can continue the data analysis just as we did together. It's a fantastic opportunity to apply what we've learned and collaborate with your fellow participants.

At the end of the course you will receive an email with a little assignment.

So, let's dive in and make the most of this hands-on data analysis adventure!
