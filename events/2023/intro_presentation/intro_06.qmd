Welcome to this exciting event where we will be exploring the world of
`Data Science Best Practices`.

It is my pleasure to pass the word to our speaker for today's event.

Dr. Simina Boca, statistician and data scientist with experience in both
academia and industry.

She worked in the analysis of omics data, population genetics, precision
medicine, and early-phase drug development.

She also taught courses, presented tutorials using R and developed a
number of R packages.

She was a co-organizer for R-Ladies DC in 2021 and 2022.

During her presentation, Dr. Boca will guide us through the different
stages of data analysis, offering expert advice on effectively
organizing and managing data science projects, highlighting key
principles and best practices for ensuring research reproducibility.
