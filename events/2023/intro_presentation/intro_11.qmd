### Rome Chapter Schedule

In recent months, `R-Ladies Rome` has been buzzing with a diverse array
of events, including `talks`, `hands-on workshops`, `coding sessions`,
and engaging `panel discussions`. These gatherings have all shared a
common theme: our passion for `R programming`, `data science`, and
`statistics.`

Recent highlights include discussions on topics such as
`Machine Learning`, `Quarto`, and the `tidyverse`. We've delved into
`infectious disease modeling` and other fascinating subjects by experts
in the field.

Our next event will be on the 30th of November with `Cara Thompson`,
continuing with the Data Visualization Month. She will lead us through
`Ten tips for better text: typography meets ggplot and friends`.

In December, we will be partnering with `R-Ladies Paris`. More info is
