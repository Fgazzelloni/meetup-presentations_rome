# R-Ladies Rome & NYC present: {.smaller}

It's now time to hand the floor over to our esteemed speaker. Tonight's event, we have the honor of hosting Dr. Hadley Wickham, Chief Scientist at Posit PBC (formerly RStudio), and a renowned figure in the world of data science.

Dr. Wickham is not only an Adjunct Professor of Statistics at the University of Auckland, Stanford University, and Rice University, but he's also the mastermind behind some of the most widely-used tools and packages in the R programming language. His contributions to the field have revolutionized the way we approach data analysis, visualization, and software development in R.

Tonight, Dr. Wickham will be talking 'R in Production,' sharing insights and best practices on how to deploy R solutions effectively in real-world environments. 

So without further ado, please join me in welcoming `Dr. Hadley Wickham`.
