Today's workshop is lead by our Expert [Bruno Rodrigues](https://www.brodrigues.co/) **Head of the Statistics Department at the Ministry of Research and Higher Education in Luxembourg**. His background spans across academia and data science consulting, where he has developed a strong foundation in data analysis and research methodologies.

Before transitioning to the public sector, Bruno gained valuable experience as a data science consultant with one of the Big Four accounting firms. His career began as a teaching and research assistant, where he developed a strong foundation in data analysis and research methodologies.

We’re thrilled to have Bruno share his insights with us today. So without further ado, let's get started with **Building Reproducible Pipelines with R, Docker and Nix**! 🚀
